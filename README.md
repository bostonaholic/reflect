# Reflect

![Reflect: An AI tool to generate your brag document](assets/github-header-image.png)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> While this tool helps document your GitHub contributions, it's crucial to remember that your impact and value to a company extends far beyond what's visible in GitHub. Many critical aspects of software engineering - such as mentoring, documentation, cross-team collaboration, and technical leadership - often happen outside of version control. For more on this topic, check out [Glue Work](https://www.noidea.dog/glue), an excellent resource about the often-overlooked but essential work that makes teams successful.

## Quickstart 🚀

### Prerequisites ⚙️

1. Install [nodenv](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv) (preferred) or [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
2. Install npm or yarn package manager
3. GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with `repo` and `read:org` scopes
4. OpenAI API key (optional, for summary and brag document generation)

### Usage 💻

1. Set up your environment variables:
```bash
cp .env{.example,}
```

2. Run the setup script to configure your environment:
```bash
./script/setup
```

3. Run the tool:
```bash
./script/run --username <github-username> --lookback <months-to-look-back> --brag
```

This will generate three markdown files in the `output` directory:
- A detailed list of your GitHub contributions
- A summarized version of your contributions
- A professional brag document highlighting your achievements

## Features ✨

- 📥 Fetches merged pull requests and closed issues from GitHub
- 🔍 Filters by author and date range (last 6 months by default)
- 📝 Generates a clean, chronological markdown document
- 🔄 Combines both PRs and issues into a single reflection document
- ⚡ Uses GitHub's official Octokit API client for efficient data retrieval
- 🤖 Optional AI-powered summary and brag document generation
- 🔒 Secure handling of API keys and sensitive data

## Usage 🛠️

Run the tool:
```bash
./script/run --username <github-username> --lookback <months-to-look-back> [--brag]
```

Example:
```bash
./script/run --username bostonaholic --lookback 6 --brag
```

### Arguments 📋

**Required:**
- `-u, --username <username>`: Your GitHub username to fetch activity for

**One of the following date options is required:**
- `-l, --lookback <number>`: Number of months to look back for activity (must be a positive number)
- `-s, --start-date <date>`: Explicit start date in DD-MM-YYYY format, that must be used with --end-date
- `-e, --end-date <date>`: Explicit end date in DD-MM-YYYY format, that must be used with --start-date

**Optional:**
- `-p, --provider <provider>`: LLM provider to use (e.g., openai, anthropic), defaults to openai
- `-m, --model <model>`: OpenAI model to use (e.g., gpt-4, gpt-3.5-turbo), defaults to gpt-4o-mini
- `-b, --brag`: Optional flag to generate a summary and brag document
- `-i, --include-orgs <orgs...>`: Only include contributions from these organizations (mutually exclusive with --exclude-orgs)
- `-x, --exclude-orgs <orgs...>`: Exclude contributions from these organizations (mutually exclusive with --include-orgs)

### Examples 🚀

Basic usage with lookback:
```bash
./script/run --username bostonaholic --lookback 6 --brag
```

Basic usage with explicit date range:
```bash
./script/run --username bostonaholic --start-date 2024-09-04 --end-date 2025-03-23 --brag
```

Choose a model:
```bash
./script/run --username bostonaholic --lookback 6 --model gpt-3-5-turbo --brag
```

Choose an LLM provider and model
```bash
./script/run --username bostonaholic --lookback 6 --provider anthropic --model claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219 --brag
```

Filter by specific organizations:
```bash
./script/run --username bostonaholic --lookback 6 --include-orgs shopify github
```

Exclude specific organizations:
```bash
./script/run --username bostonaholic --lookback 6 --exclude-orgs secret archived
```

### Environment Variables 🔐

Required environment variables:
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Your GitHub Personal Access Token (required)

To create a GitHub Personal Access Token:
1. Go to GitHub Settings > Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens > Tokens (classic)
2. Generate a new token with the following scopes:
   - `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
   - `read:org` (Read organization data)
3. Copy the token and add it to your `.env` file

Required for making LLM calls (one of):
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

Optional for using a different provider-compatible endpoint:
- `OPENAI_BASE_URL`
- `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`

## Security Considerations 🔒

- API keys are only accepted through environment variables, not command-line arguments
- All file operations are sanitized to prevent path traversal attacks
- GitHub API rate limits are properly handled with informative error messages
- Input validation is performed on all user-provided parameters
- Output files are restricted to a predefined list of allowed filenames
- GitHub tokens are never logged or exposed in error messages

## Output 📁

The script will generate one or more markdown files in the `output` directory:

### output/contributions.md 📊
Contains:
- A chronological list of your merged pull requests and closed issues
- Each item includes:
  - Title
  - Closing date
  - Description/body
- Items are sorted by closing date (most recent first)
- Activity for the specified time period

### output/summarized_contributions.md (with --brag flag) 📝
Contains:
- A technical summary of your contributions
- Groups similar contributions together
- Highlights key technical changes and improvements
- Identifies patterns in the work
- Notes significant architectural changes

### output/brag_document.md (with --brag flag) 🎯
Contains:
- A professional brag document highlighting your achievements
- Focuses on business impact and value
- Emphasizes collaboration and leadership
- Highlights key metrics and improvements
- Suitable for performance reviews or portfolio

Note: The `output` directory and all generated files are automatically git-ignored to prevent accidental commits.

## Troubleshooting 🔍

1. If you get TypeScript errors, ensure you're using Node.js v22 or higher:

```bash
node --version
```

2. If you get GitHub API errors:
   - Verify your GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) is correctly set in your `.env` file
   - Check that your PAT has the required scopes (`repo` and `read:org`)
   - Ensure your PAT hasn't expired (they can be set to expire after a certain time)
   - Verify you have access to the repositories you're trying to fetch data from

3. If the script runs but generates an empty file:
   - Check that you have activity in the specified time period
   - Verify your GitHub username is correct
   - Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access the repositories

4. If you get an error about the OpenAI API key:
   - Make sure you've set it in your `.env` file
   - Check that the API key is valid and has sufficient credits
   - Verify the .env file is in the correct location

5. If you get environment variable errors:
   - Ensure your `.env` file exists and is properly formatted
   - Check that there are no spaces around the `=` sign in your `.env` file
   - Verify the `.env` file is in the root directory of the project
