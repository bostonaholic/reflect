# Performance Optimization Rules

## Code Level Optimization
- Use appropriate data structures for the use case
- Implement caching strategies where beneficial
- Minimize unnecessary object creation
- Use async/await for I/O operations
- Implement proper error boundaries

## Memory Management
- Implement proper garbage collection
- Monitor memory leaks
- Use appropriate buffer sizes
- Implement proper cleanup in event listeners

## Monitoring and Profiling
- Implement performance monitoring
- Use profiling tools
- Set up performance budgets
- Monitor key performance indicators
- Implement proper logging

## Testing
- Include performance tests
- Set up performance benchmarks
- Test under load
- Monitor performance regressions
